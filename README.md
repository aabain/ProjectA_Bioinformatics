This project aims to display data about the circulating blood from first time myocardial infraction (AMI) patients withing 48 hours of MI. I am currently at the stage of making tables from the data I have downloaded from ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo and have written a working parser which extracts the data I need to make these tables. The parser contains comments as to what each part of code does and I plan to update this as I expand my knowledge on the code. I have created 3 out of my 4 tables and just need to link my tables up and make sure python and MySQL are able to communicate this information between them. UPDATED 11/02/2015
