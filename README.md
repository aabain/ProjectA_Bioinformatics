This project aims to display data about the circulating blood from first time myocardial infraction (AMI) patients withing 48 hours of MI. I am currently at the stage of making tables from the data I have downloaded from ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo and have written a working parser which extracts the data I need to make these tables. The parser contains comments as to what each part of code does and I plan to update this as I expand my knowledge on the code. I have created 3 out of my 4 tables and just need to link my tables up and make sure python and MySQL are able to communicate this information between them. UPDATED 11/02/2015

 
I have successfully linked up all the tables and have uploaded the code to my github repository. I am going to work through the exercises that are included in the help sheets on mydundee. UPDATED 14/02/2015


I have worked through the making a html tutorial within the help sheets and have successfully linked two webpages together. I have made the public_html directory and pushed this to my git repository and within this is the coding for the two html files. UPDATED 19/02/2015


I am finding the CGI hard to get my head around, I will ask Dr Martin how to do this after the weekend has passed. In the meantime I will begin to write up my report and if I have time try and get my head around the CGI part of the help sheets. UPDATED 21/02/2015


Dr Martin explained the CGI part of the help sheets and I feel like I understand the conceps of it, going to try it when I get home. UPDATED 23/02/2015


I may understand the conceps of CGI but I do not fully understand how to put this into practice. I will try various ways of writing the code and see if they work. UPDATED 24/02/2015


I finally finished writing up all the code, although it does not work. I am going to focus on doing the main bulk of my report but will have a look at the code once I am happy with the report. UPDATED 26/02/2015


Tried to rectify the errors in the code but could not get the search bar in my final webpage to work. I have completed the final webpage and am happy with the outcome, bar the search bar not working. I am finishing up the final areas of my report. UPDATE 27/02/2015
