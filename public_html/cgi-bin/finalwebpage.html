<title>Gene Expression of Peripheral Blood from First Time Acute Myocardial Infarction Patients</title></head>
    <body bg colour='#A4A4A4'>
      <h1>First time acute Myocardial Infarction; the peripheral blood</h1>
      <p>Peripheral blood can hold the answer to many questions, as it is the main cellular component of the blood, consisting of the red blood cells, the white blood cells and the platlets.</p>
      <p>An experiment was therefore carried out to test the effects of first time myocardial infarctions on the components of the peripheral blood. Here, a variety of patients whom have had a myocardial infarction had their blood tested for a variety of markers and expression of genes that could help give insight into the occurence of myocardial infarctions and the consequences of this in the blood.</p>
      <p>The data from this study, accessed from the Gene Expression Omnibus website has been analyzed and by selecting Enter a Gene_ID, various types of information will be returned on the Gene_ID selected and other linked data associated with this.</p>
